## Conway's Game of Life

> The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
> The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
> One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

This is a WIP of one of my projects to implement famous algorithms using computers. Most of the codes in this repository are just for studying and I don't advise people to use it for
work or anything serious, they are not completely protected from flaws, bugs and errors.
