# Roxac's Code Cellar
Algorithm implementantion of anything I decide to be interesting to learn and adapt.

Sometimes there'll be re-usage of the same algorithm to show examples in how using it alongside different codes to achieve different results.

Within time I'll be updating, correcting bugs and improving the codes as necessary.

**Already finished codes;**

* BubbleSort (Finished) - Implemented in Python, C++ and C#
* Conway's Game of Life (WIP) - Implementing in C++
* Exponential Calculator (Finished) - Implemented in Python and C++
* Find All Occurences of a Character Inside a String (Finished) - Implemented in C++
* Graph Implementation (WIP) - Implementing in C { directed and undirected }
* Input Mask for HTML (Finished) - Implemented in JavaScript
* Remove Specific Characters from String (Finished) - Implemented in C++
* Validador de CPF/CNPJ (Terminado) - Implementado em JavaScript e C++

**Next (planned) algorithms and projects to be implemented;**

* Binary Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* Linked List
* Hash Table
* Consuming a WebService in Python
* Snake Game (Console)
* Various Calculators (eg. Cosine Calculator, Sine Calculator...)
* Maze Generator (2D)
* Maze Generator (3D) - with Unity

> All the codes in the repository ARE NOT FOOLPROOF. They were created while I'm studying how to improve my knowledge not only about programming but also mathematics, logic and computers in general. I'm still a student and I can and do commit a lot of errors. Please, do not use any of these codes for professional work since I can not guarantee the quality of them for now.
